<h2>Cairns</h2>
<p>the Cairns area was inhabited by the Gimuy Walubara Yidinji people,[8] who still claim their Native Title rights.[9] The area is known in the local Yidiny language as Gimuy.[8]
In 1770, James Cook mapped the future site of Cairns, naming it Trinity Bay. Closer investigation by several official expeditions 100 years later established its potential for development into a port.
